# Intro Programming Projects

This repository contains small Visual Basic projects created during my first computer programming class.  
These projects focus on learning core programming concepts through simple games and utilities.

## Projects

### Magic Eight Ball
A program that returns a "random" response to a user’s question, similar to a Magic 8-Ball toy.

### No Vowels Game
A text-based program that removes vowels from user input to demonstrate string manipulation.

### Number Guessing Game
A game where the program generates a random number and the user guesses until they get it correct.

### Pong
A basic Pong game with a computer-controlled opponent.

### Tic Tac Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to take turns on the same computer.

## What I Learned
- Variables and conditionals
- Loops and control flow
- String manipulation
- Random number generation
- Event driven programming using forms
- Breaking problems into smaller steps

## Notes
These projects are my first exposure to programming and problem solving.
